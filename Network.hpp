/**
 * 
 * @file: Network.hpp
 * @purpose: A design template class that has all the private data members like temp_items that are all {T} items which in this project will
 *           be the different Accounts. As well as the static const capacity that wont change throughout implementation or design. The item_count
 *           is also a private members which is either added if an account is added to the network, or subtracted if an account is removed. 
 *           this is our way of keeping track of how many items are in the Account.
